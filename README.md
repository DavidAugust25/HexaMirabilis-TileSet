 HexaMirabilis is a Civ Six-fied Tileset for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).
 
 It is Based on HexaRealm tiles (Shape and Size) and Largely inspired by Civ 6's Mods and Features, such as TerraMirabilis and the placeable Wonders present in the game.
 
 This Tileset focuses on variety with plenty of details that will make even the most barren landscapes look Wonderful!
